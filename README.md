A dice game for multiple players

Text based dice game you can play with your friends and, if you wish, the feindishly good Digital Overloard.

Scoring and game rules are outlined thouroughly in the game. The basics are:
- Roll dice and keep at least one die per roll to keep your turn going.
- You are allowed to keep 1's and 5's, along with a few special combinations.
  - Any three or more of a kind in one throw.
  - Three pairs.
  - A straight of all six dice.
- Keep throwing untill you have no keepers, but lose all the points for your turn, or you decide to keep the points you have
   so far and end your turn. 

This is the first project I started after a breif intro to Python and an exercise to write a program that rolls a die and asks
if you'd like to roll again. It keeps growing! :) It was a lot of fun to make and I hope you enjoy playing. You can check out the progress of making this
into a modern app [here.](https://github.com/llpk79/ten-thousand-app)
